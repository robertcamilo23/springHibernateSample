DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------
FacilityManagementClient contains main()
and is used to populate the database with
a new building. We have a facility service
that contains all of our DAO references for
making CRUD work. A full client that is
easily usable is not done yet. The main 
focus was getting Hibernate and Spring 
properly implemented, and that has been
done.
